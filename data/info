This folder is where all the data for the blog is kept.

Users each get their own directory. This is named after their email
address so as to be easy to identify them by. Seeing as this is intended
to be for one person, there should really only ever be one here, but I'd
like for the system to be flexible enough in case I want to let multiple
people use the  blog later.
